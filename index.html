<p>
My name is Damian Lee... I'm a student of Dunman High School. Currently in the 1st year of 'Junior High'. </p>
<p>
Hereâ€™s our school website link because I feel like it's obligatory to do so or something: <a href ="www.dhs.sg"> Dunman High School  </a>. </p>
<br>
<p>Here are the things I 'love to do the most' : </p> 
<ul>
<li>Playing miscellaneous computer games. I don't list a genre because... Well, the range of games I play is... quite large. Ya can find me playing First Person Shooters, to Strategy Card Games, to 2D Party Platformers... </li>
<li>Eh... Spacey stuff. Think black holes, or whatever ya shallow minds relate to that vast, completely not empty void. </li>
<li>Reading certain books. Usually slice of life, or... sci-fi/fantasy? Think 'Wonder' or 'Ender's Game'.</li>
</ul>
